The zipped file has a custom script tool meant to be used in ArcMap 10.7 or below(Depending if the functions used are available in the lower versions). This tool extracts rasters from NetCDF files for various variables such as u, v, vf etc based on time. Feel free to download and use it as per your requirements. You can always reach out to me if any help is needed!
